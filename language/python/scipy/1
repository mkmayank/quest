* Data Structure
* 2 primary data structure - Series (1-D) , Dataframe (2-D)
* DataFrame is a container for Series, and Series is a container for scalars

#######################

>>> import pandas as pd

* NaN (not a number) is the standard missing data marker used in pandas.

#### Series
* 1-D labeled array capable of holding any data type
* The axis labels are collectively referred to as the index.
>>> s = pd.Series(data, index=index)
* data can be scalar, python dict , scalar
* index is list of axis labels
* If data is an ndarray, index must be the same length as data. If no index is passed, one will be created having values [0, ..., len(data) - 1].
* If data is a scalar value, an index must be provided. The value will be repeated to match the length of index
* Series acts very similarly to a ndarray, and is a valid argument to most NumPy functions
