Problem Statement method
* what makes to think that there is a performance problem?
* has this system ever performed well?
* what has changed recently?
    * software?, hardware?, load?
* can the performance degradation be expressed in terms of latency or run time ?
* does the problem affect other applications?
* what is the environment?
    * software, hardware, instance type, versions, configurations

Workload characterization method
* Who is causing the load?
    * PID, UID, IP, addr, ...
* Why is the load called?
    * code path, stack trace
* What is the load?
    * IOPS, tput, type, r/w
* How is the load changing over time ?

USE method
* for every resource check
    * utilization
    * saturation
    * errors

* make a block diagram and check all three for every block
