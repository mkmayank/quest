Application layer - DNS, HTTP, Telnet, SSH, FTP, SNMP, SMTP, DHCP, RDP, NTP etc
    Layer 7: Application Layer  - data
    Layer 6: Presentation Layer
    Layer 5: Session Layer

Transport layer - TCP, UDP
    Layer 4: Transport Layer - segment / segment for TCP . datagram for UDP

Internet layer - IP, ICMP, ARP, RARP, IGMP
    Layer 3: Network Layer  - datagram

Link / Network Acess layer - Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI, X.25, Frame Relay
    Layer 2: Data Link Layer    -   frame
    Layer 1: Physical Layer     -   bit, symbol

================================================================
* OSI model
Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model

Application     -   allow access to network resources
Presentation    -   translate, encrypt, and compress data
Session         -   establish, manage, and terminate sessions
Transport       -   provide reliable process to process message delivery and error recovery
Network         -   move packets from source to destination to provide internetworking
Deta Link       -   organize bits into frames, provides hop-to-hop delivery
Physical        -   transmit bits over a medium, provide mechanical and electrical specifications

================================================================
Physical Layer (Layer 1)

    responsible for moving individual bits from one (node) to the next.

- Physical characteristics of interfaces and media ??? chapter 3
- Representation of bits (stream of bits)
    To be transmitted, bits must be encoded into signalsâ€”electrical or optical
    defines the type of encoding (how 0s and 1s are changed to signals)
- Data rate - transmission rate
- Synchronization of bits
- concerned with Line configuration
    - e.g.
        in point-to-point configuration two devices are connected through dedicated link
        multippoint configuratin, link is hared between several devices
- physical topology
    - e.g. mesh, star, ring, bus
- Transmission mode
    - e.g. simplex, half duplex, full duplex

================================================================
Data Link Layer (Layer 2)

    transforms the physical layer, a raw transmission facility, to a reliable link
    defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices

- Framing
    divides the stream of bits received from the network layer into manageable data units called frames

- Physical addressing ?? mac
- Flow Control
    - e.g.
        if receiver data rate < sender data rate
        the data link layer imposes a flow control mechanism to prevent overwhelming the receiver
- Error control (detects and possibly corrects errors)
    - detect and retransmit damaged or lost frames
    - recognize duplicate frames
    - normally achieved through a trailer added to the end of the frame ???

================================================================
Network Layer (Layer 3)

    responsible for the source-to-destination delivery of a packet

data link layer oversees the delivery of the packet between two systems on the same network (link)
network layer ensures that each packet gets from its point of origin to its final destination
if system are on same link, there is no need for network layer

- Logical addressing
    - .e.g. IP ???
- Routing
    - routers or switch

================================================================
Transport Layer (layer 4)

    responsible for process-to-process delivery of the entire message

network layer oversees source-to-destination delivery of individual packets, does not recognize any relationship between those packets
transport layer ensures that the whole message arrives intact and in order

- Service-point addressing
    - service-point address (port address)
- Segmentation and reassembly
    - message is divided into transmittable segments
    - each segment contains a sequence number
    - sequence numbers helps to reassemble the message correctly at destination
        - identify and replace packets that were lost in transmission
- Connection control
    .e.g. connectionless , connection-oriented
- Flow control  (process-to-process)
- Error control (process-to-process)

================================================================
Session Layer (layer 5)

    provides the mechanism for opening, closing and managing a session between end-user application processes

- Dialog control
    - deciding whose turn it is to talk
        - halfduplex or full-duplex
        Simplex Sessions - TV Broadcasting, Radio Broadcasting, etc
        Half Duplex Sessions - CB Radio (Police Wireless), Walkie Talkie, etc
        Full Duplex Sessions - Telephone, Audio or Video Conferencing, etc
        identification of mode of communication for a session is called Dialog Control
    - dialog management is implemented via use of a data token
        - the token is sent back and forth, and a user may transmit only when it possesses the token
- Synchronization
    - move the two session entities into a known state
    - responsible for session checkpointing and recovery
    - transport layer handles only communication errors, synchronization deals with upper layer errors
      e.g.
        in a file transfer, the transport layer might deliver data correctly,
        but the application layer might be unable to write the file because the file system is full
    - Synchronization is achieved through the use of sequence numbers. The ISO protocols provide both major and minor synchronization points.
        When resynchronizing, one can only go back as far as the previous major synchronization point.
        In addition, major synchronization points are acknowledged through explicit messages (making their use expensive)
    e.g. if a system is sending a file of 2,000 pages,
        it is advisable to insert checkpoints after every 100 pages to ensure that each 100-page unit is received and acknowledged independently
        In this case,if a crash happens during the transmission of page 523, the only pages that need to be resent after system recovery are pages 501 to 523
        Pages previous to 501 need not be resent
    e.g.
        web conferencing, in which the streams of audio and video must be synchronous to avoid so-called lip sync problems
        TV programs, where streams of audio and video need to be seamlessly merged and transitioned from one to the other to avoid silent airtime or excessive overlap.

================================================================
Presentation Layer (layer 6)

    define the data format and encryption

- Encoding
    - responsible for interoperability between different encoding methods
        presentation layer(sender) information (sender-dependent format) => common format
        presentation layer(reciver) common format => information (receiver-dependent format)
- Encryption
- Compression

================================================================
Application Layer (layer 7)

    real process to process information

================================================================

session layer (along with the presentation layer) add services to the transport layer that are likely to be of use to applications,
so that each application doesn't have to provide its own implementation

################################################################
* TCP/IP model

TCP/IP Protocol Suite is normally shown as a five-layer stack
it only defines the three upper layers
    network, transport, and application layers

no specific protocol for the physical layer
no specific protocol for the data link layer
    supports all of the standard and proprietary protocols
    communication is also between two hops or nodes

    node to node

network layer
    internet protocol (IP)

    responsible for sending individual datagrams
    datagrams travel independently of each other
    no track of routes
    no facility for reordering once they arrive at destination

    end to end
    network layers of the routers can inspect the source and destination of the packet for
    finding the best route, but they are not allowed to change the contents of the packet

    every node need to have network layer

transport layer
    User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
    Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)

    responsible for delivering the whole message

    end to end
    only end nodes(computers) need to have transport layer

no session or presentation layer
    if some of the functionalities mentioned in the session and presentation are needed
    it can be included in the development of that piece of software

application layer
    end to end
===============================================================

physical layer      - bit
data link layer     - frame                                 -   physical address
network layer       - datagram                              -   logical address
transport layer     - segment or user datagram or packet    -   port address
application layer   - message                               -   application specific address

===============================================================

end to end / node to node
        in node to node, packet may be changed various time in between
        in end to end, packet remains same

################################################################
* Addressing

    Four levels of addresses are used in TCP/IP protocols:
        1. physical address ( link address )
        2. logical address
        3. port address
        4. application-specific address

physical address
    e.g. mac address
    - address of node in network
    - size and format varies dependending on network
    - unicast or multicast or broadcast (supports depends on network)
    - changes from hop to hop

logical address
    e.g. ip
    - address of host in network
    - 32 bit (IPv4), 64 bit (IPv6)
    - unicast or multicast or broadcast (limitations on broadcast address ???)
    - remains same

port address
    - address of process
    - 16 bits in length
    - remains same

application-specific address
    e.g. mail ids, urls

################################################################
################################################################
* Project 802

    project of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
    for defining LAN and WAN standards and technologies

    IEEE divides data link layer into 2 sublayers:
        1. logical link control (LLC)
        2. media access control (MAC)

- Medium access control (MAC) layer
    responsible for gaining access to a medium and permission to transmit data

- Logical link control (LLC) layer
    responsible for identifying and encapsulating network layer protocols
    controls error checking
    frame synchronization

=================================================================
Ethernet 802.3 (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)

- unreliable medium
    does not provide any mechanism for acknowledging received frames

- Ethernet frame

    64 bytes - 1518 bytes (without preamble and SFD)

    contains seven fields:
        1. preamble                     - 7 bytes   (physical layer header)
        2. Start frame delimiter        - 1 byte    (physical layer header)
        3. Destination address          - 6 byte
        4. Sourde address               - 6 byte
        5. length or type of data unit  - 2 bytes
        6. upper-layer data             - 46 - 1500 bytes
        7. CRC                          - 4 bytes

    Preamble
        - alerts the receiving system to the coming frame & enables it to synchronize its input timing
        - pattern provides only an alert and a timing pulse
        - pattern allows the stations to miss some bits at the beginning of the frame
        - actually added at the physical layer and is not (formally) part of the frame

    Start frame delimiter (SFD)
        - signals beginning of the frame , fixed e.g, 10101011
        - warns the station or stations that this is the last chance for synchronization
        - last 2 bits are 11 and alert the receiver that the next field is the destination address
        - SFD is added at the physical layer

    Destination address
    Source address

    Length or type
        - original ethernet uses this field as type to define upper layer via MAC frame
        - IEEE standard uses it to denote length of data

    Data

    CRC
        - contains error detection information

Each station on an Ethernet network has its own network interface card (NIC)
    - 6 byte physical address (48 bits) (normally written in hexadecimal notation)
    - data link address / physical address / MAC address (Media Access Control)

The least significant bit of the first byte defines the type of address
    0 => unicast
    1 => multicast

    all 48 bits are 1 => broadcast

=================================================================
original Ethernet with 10-Mbps which is history
    - access method for traditional ethernet
        CSMA/CD carrier sense multiple access with collision detection
    - rarely used

    - logical topology is always a bus
    - medium is shared between stations and only one station at a time can use it
        all stations receive a frame sent by a station
        real destination keeps the frame while the rest drop it

    - requires that each station first listen to the medium

    - collision may happen due to propagation delay
        a station may sense the medium and find it idle,
        only because the first bit sent by another station has not yet been received

    - if there is a collision, the frame is sent again.
    - each station continues to send bits in the frame until it detects the collision

    - for CSMA/CD to work, need a restriction on the frame size
    - before sending the last bit of the frame
        the sending station must detect a collision if any and abort the transmission
    - b/c once the entire frame is sent, does not keep a copy of the frame and does not monitor the line for collision detection

    - transmission time must be at least two times the maximum propagation time

    e.g.
        if maximum propagation time is 25.6 micro second
            frame transmission time = 25.6 micro second * 2 = 51.2 us
            min size of fram  = 10M bps * 51.2 us
                              = 10 * 10^6 bps * 51.2 * 10^-6 us
                              = 512 bits
                              = 64 bytes

Standard Ethernet implementations:

Characteristics     10Base5             10Base2         10Base-T        10Base-F
Medium              Thick Coax          Thin coax       2 UTP           2 Fiber
Maximum length      500 m                185 m          100 m           2000 m

UTP unshielded twist pair
=================================================================

Fast Ethernet (802.3u) 1995 - 100Mbps
    - only star topology is kept
        half-duplex approach
            the stations are connected via a hub
            access method is the same (CSMA/CD)
        full-duplex approach
            the connection is made via a switch with buffers at each port
            no need for CSMA/CD
            implementations keep CSMA/CD for backward compatibility

    - autonegotiation
        allows two devices to negotiate the mode or data rate of operation
        e.g.
            10Mbps can communicate with 100Mbps
        allow one device to have multiple capabilities
        allow a station to check a hubâ€™s capabilities

Gigabit Ethernet (802.3z) 1998 - 1000Mbps
    - half duplex is rare

Ten-Gigabit Ethernet (802.3ae) 2002-06 - 10 Gbps

==================================================================
Frame Bursting

to allow longer network , min frame length is increased (Carrier extension)
and if shorter data to be sent padding will be needed

Carrier extension is very inefficient if we have a series of short frames to send
to improve efficiency, frame bursting is used
Instead of adding an extension to each frame, multiple frames are sent with padding between frames

==================================================================
Wireless LAN 802.11

The standard defines two kinds of services:
    1. basic service set (BSS)
    2. extended service set (ESS)

BSS
    - building block of a wireless LAN
    - made of
            stationary or mobile wireless stations and
            an optional central base station, known as the access point (AP)

    - ad hoc architecture
        BSS without AP (stand alone network)
        cannot send data to other BSSs

        stations can form a network without the need of an AP
        they can locate one another and agree to be part of a BSS

        stations within BSS can communicate with each other

    - iinfrastructure network
        BSS with an AP

ESS
    - made up of two or more BSS with APs
    - APs are connected through a distribution system, which can be any LAN such as ethernet


Stations cna be of three types based on their mobility:
    no-transition           - within on BSS
    BSS-transition          - moving across BSSs but within ESS
    ESS-transition mobility - moving across ESSs

Wireless LANs cannot implement CSMA/CD for three reasons:
    1. costly and increased bandwidth requirement
            as station must be able to send data and receive collision signals at the same time
    2. hidden station problem
    3. Signal fading due to distance
            could prevent a station at one end from hearing a collision at the other end

==================================================================
CSMA/CA (carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance)

    before sending frame
    source station senses the medium by checking the energy level at the carrier frequency
    if medium is continuously idle for DCF Interframe Space (DIFS) duration
        then the station sends a control frame called the request to send (RTS)

    after receiving the RTS
        destination station sends a control frame clear to send (CTS)
        after SIFS

    source station sends data after SIFS

    destination station sends an acknowledgment after SIFS

Short Interframe Space (SIFS)
    ??? not understanded properly
    amount of time in microseconds required for a wireless interface to process a received frame
    and to respond with a response frame

Network Allocation Vector (NAV)

    - other stations defer sending their data if one station acquires access

    - station includes duration of time it needs to occupy, while sending an RTS frame
    - stations affected by this transmission create a timer called a network allocation vector (NAV)
        - which shows how much time must pass before these stations are allowed to check for idleness

In case collision during the time when RTS or CTS control frames are in transition (handshaking period)
CTS won't be received and sender will try again

Fragmentation
    division of a large frame into smaller ones

==================================================================
802.11 Frame format ???
Addressing  ???
==================================================================
Hidden Station Problem
    it is solved

    B==A==C
    lets say B is in range of A but not C and vice versa
    C will never know about B RTS
    buy when A send CTS , it will also be recived by C
    and C will know that some hidden node is sending data and C will not send data

Exposed Station Problem
    not solved

    B==A==C==D
    if A wants to send data to B and C to D
    only one can send

==================================================================
Bluetooth (802.15) , wireless personal area network (PAN) operable in room or hall
    - ad-hoc network
    - bluetooth network can not be large

2 types of networks
    1. Piconet
    2. Scatternet

Piconet
    - upto 8 stations
        - one is primary
        - rest are secondary
    - all synchronize their clocks and hopping sequence with primary
    - additional 8 secondaries can be in parked state
    - communication can be one-to-one or one-to-many

Scatternet
    - piconet combined to form scatternet
    - secondary Station in one piconet can be primary in another piconet

Repeater
    - receives signal before it becomes too weak or corrupted,
      regenerates and sends the refreshed signal
    - no intelligence / filtering capabilities

    - changes the physical address of the packet (both source and destination) when it forwards the packet

three-layer switch
    - low cost, high port, for offices, ???

A repeater or a bridge connects segments of a LAN.

Switching

    decsion to select one of output port at connecting device

Circuit Switching
    - physical circuit (or channel) is established before the delivery of the message
    - whole message is sent without being divided into packets
    - never implemented at network layer
    - mostly used at physical layer

    e.g. old telephone lines

Packet Switching
    - todays network layer is packet-switched network
    - message at is divided into manageable packets and assembled at destination

network layer is designed as a packet-switched network

connectionless service
    - network layer protocol treats each packet independently
    - forwarding decision is based on the destination address of the packet

connection-oriented service
    - there is a relation between all packets belonging to a message
    - forwarding decision is based on the label of the packet
    - a virtual connection is set up to define the path for the datagrams before delievery of datagrams

    - packet must contain source, destination and flow label (virtual circuit identifier)

    - there is no need for source and destination addresses, only flow label is good
      they are there if part of route is connectionless

    To create a connection-oriented servicee
    three-phase process is used
        1. setup
            - source and destination addresses of the sender and receiver is used to make table entries for the connection-oriented service
            - router creates an entry for a virtual circuit
                - Two auxiliary packets exchanged between the sender and the receiver
                    1. request packet
                    2. acknowledgment packet

                routers creates label in its table on recieving request packet and forwards it
                    info in table
                    incoming port, label_this, outgoing port

                destination on recieving request packet sends back acknowledgment packet with its label
                acknowledgment packet completes the entries in the switching tables

                routers fills label in its table the recieving label and forwards it previous router
                    info in table
                    incoming port, label_this, outgoing port, label_next

        2. data transfer
                sender sends datagram with recieving label
                next router read its table match with label_this and changes label to label_next and sends

        3. teardown
            - source sends special packet called a teardown packet
            - destination responds witha confirmation packet
            - routers deleted entries from table

        e.g.
        tables in routers
                    Incoming            Outgoing
                    Port Label          Port  Label
        router1     1    14             3     66
        router2     1    66             3     22
        router3     1    22             4     77

        source will send datagrams with label 14
        destination will send datagrams with label 77
