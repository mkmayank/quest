The data link layer
provides node-to-node data transferâ€”a link between two directly connected nodes.
It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer.
It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices.
It also defines the protocol for flow control between them.

IEEE 802 divides the data link layer into two sublayers:
1. Medium access control (MAC) layer 
    responsible for
    controlling how devices in a network gain access to a medium and permission to transmit data
2. Logical link control (LLC) layer
    responsible for
    identifying and encapsulating network layer protocols
    controls error checking
    frame synchronization.
