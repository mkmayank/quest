RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
    -   public-key cryptosystem
    -   encryption key is public and it is different from the decryption key which is kept secret (private)
    -   asymmetry is based on "factoring problem"
        -   practical difficulty of the factorization of the product of two large prime numbers
