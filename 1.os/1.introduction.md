Operating system can be seen as:
* resource allocator (in context of hardware)
    * CPU time, memory space, storage space, I/O devices, ...
* control programs (in context of programs)
    * manages execution of user programs


---

Computer system consists of CPUs and device controllers connected through a common bus that provides access between components and shared memory.

Each device controller is in charge of a specific type of device (e.g. disk drive,
audio device, or graphics display)

**device controller** maintains
* some local buffer storage and
* a set of special-purpose registers

device controller is responsible for
* moving the data between the devices that it controls and its local buffer storage

os have device driver for each device controller

device driver
* understands the device controller and
* provides the rest of the os with a uniform interface to the device

CPU and the device controllers can execute in parallel, competing for memory cycles

to ensure orderly access to the shared memory, a memory controller synchronizes access to the memory

---

Interrupt
* hardwares (device controllers and hardware faults) may trigger interrupt to send signals to CPU usually by way of the system bus

When the CPU is interrupted
* it stops what it is doing and immediately transfers execution to a fixed location
* fixed location usually contains the starting address where the service routine for the interrupt is located
* interrupt service routine executes
* on completion, CPU resumes the interrupted computation

Overview
* important part of a computer architecture
* each computer design has its own interrupt mechanism, but several functions are common
* interrupts must be handled quickly, as they occur very frequently
* table of pointers (**interrupt vector**) is stored in low memory(first hundred or so)
* these locations hold the addresses of the interrupt service routines for various devices
* interrupts transfer control to appropriate generic service routine
* generic routine examines interrupt information
* array or **interrupt vector** is indexed by unique number

Basic interrupt mechanism:
* CPU hardware has a wire call **interrupt-request line** that CPU senses after executing every instruction.
* if it senses signal on the line, it reads interrupt number and jumps to **interrupt-handler routine** by using interrupt number as index into **interrupt vector**

1. device controller raises an interrupt by assering singal on the interrupt request line
2. CPU catches interrupt
3. dispatches it to interrupt handler
4. handler clears the interrupt by servicing the device
    1. interrupt handler saves any state it will be changing during its operation
    2. determines cause of the interrupt
    3. performs required processing
    4. performs state restore
    5. executes a return_from_interrupt instruction to return the CPU to the execution state prior to interrupt

Modern OS interrupt handling required features:
1. ability to defer interrupt handling during critical processing
2. efficient way to dispatch to proper interrupt handler for a device
3. multilevel interrupts with priority degree

features are provided as:

1. To defer interrupt handling, CPUs have 2 interrupt request lines:

    1. **nonmaskable interrupt**
        * reserved for events such as unrecoverable memory errors
    2. **maskable**
        * can be turned off by CPU before execution of ciritical instruction
        * used by device controllers to request service

2. efficient way to dispatch
    * problem:
        * computers have more devices(hence more interrupt handlers) than they have address elemets in interrupt vector
    * solution:
        * **interrupt chaining**
            * each element in interrupt vector points to head of a list of handlers
            * each handler is called one by one until one is found thaat can service
    * structure is compromise between overhead of huge interrupt table and inefficiency of dispatching to a single interrupt handler

3. interrupt priority level
    ???

* CPU can load instruction only from memory, so any programs must first be loaded into memory to run.
* All forms of memory provide an array of bytes
* Each byte has its own address
* Interaction is achieved through a sequence of load or store instructions to specific memory addresses
* load instruction
    * moves a byte or word from main memory to an internal register within the CPU
* store instruction
    * moves the content of a register to main memory
* Aside from explicit loads and stores, the CPU automatically loads instructions from main memory for execution from the location stored in the program counter

---

* interrupt-driven I/O is fine for moving small amounts of data but can produce high overhead when used for bulk data movement
    * to solve this problem, **direct memory access ( DMA )** is used.
    * After setting up buffers, pointers, and counters for the I/O device, the device controller transfers an entire block of data directly to or from the device and main memory, with no intervention by the CPU
    * Only one interrupt is generated per block, to tell the device driver that the operation has completed
    * While the device controller is performing these operations, the CPU is available to accomplish other work
* Some high-end systems use switch rather than bus architecture
    * On these systems, multiple components can talk to other components concurrently, rather than competing for cycles on a shared bus

---

Single-Processor Systems
* have single processor containing one CPU with a single processing core
* have other special-purpose processors as well, device-specific processors, such as disk, keyboard, and graphics controllers
    * special-purpose processors
        * run a limited instruction set
        * do not run processes
        * OS may talk with them, e.g.
            * disk-controller microprocessor receives a sequence of requests from the main CPU core and implements its own disk queue and scheduling algorithm
        * OS cannot talk with some, e.g.
            * microprocessor in the keyboard to convert the keystrokes into codes to be sent to the CPU
        * special-purpose processors are low-level components built into the hardware

Multiprocessor Systems
* traditionally, have two (or more) processors, each with a single-core CPU
* processors share the computer bus and sometimes the clock, memory, and peripheral devices
* **symmetric multiprocessing ( SMP )**
    * each peer CPU processor performs all tasks
    * each CPU processor has its own set of registers, as well as a private or local cache, all processors share physical memory over the system bus
* **muticore processors**
    * mutil cores on same chip
    * each core has its own register set, as well as its own local cache
    * shared cache is there in chip to be shared with all cores
    * mutilcore processor with N cores appears on OS as N standard CPUs
* **NUMA**
    * adding more cpu adds causes contention for the system bus to become bottleneck
    * solution is to provide each CPU (or group of CPU s) with its own local memory that is accessed via a small, fast local bus
    * CPU s are connected by a shared system interconnect, so that all CPU s share one physical address space
    * known as **non-uniform memory access, or NUMA**
    * limitaition:
        * increased latency when CPU must access remote memory across system interconnect
            * e.g. cpu0 cannot access the local memory of cpu3 as quickly as it can itw own, slowing down performance
    * because NUMA can scale to accomodate large number of processors, they are becoming popular
* **blade servers** ???
    * multiple processor boards, I/O boards, and networking boards are placed in the same chassis
    * each blade processor board boots independently and runs its own os
    * consist of multiple independent multiprocessor systems

**Core**        | basic computation unit of the CPU  |


Clustered systems
* composed of two or more individual systems or nodes joined together
    * each node is typically a multicore system
    * loosely coupled. We should note
* share storage and are closely linked via a local-area network LAN
* ability to continue providing service proportional to the level
of surviving hardware is called **graceful degradation**

---

**bootstrap program**
* required for a computer to start
* typically, stored within the computer hardware in firmware
* initializes all aspects of the system, from CPU registers to device controllers to memory contents
* bootstrap program must know
    * how to load the operating system and
    * how to start executing that system
* must locate the operating-system kernel and load it into memory
* Once the kernel is loaded and executing, it can start providing services to
the system and its users
* Some services are provided outside of the kernel by system programs that are loaded into memory at boot time to become **system daemons**, which run the entire time the kernel is running
* On Linux, the first system program is “ systemd ,” and it starts many other daemons
* Once this phase is complete, the system is fully booted, and the system waits for some event to occur
* software generated interrupt is a **trap** (or an exception) caused
    * either by an error (e.g. division by zero or invalid memory access)
    * or by a specific request from a user program that an OS service be performed by executing a special operation called a **system call**

differentiation between the execution of operating-system code and user-defined code is necessary
* most computer systems provide hardware support that allows differentiation among various modes of execution
* Atleast 2 modes
    1. user mode
    2. kernel mode (supervisor mode, system mode, or privileged mode)
* A bit, called the mode bit, is added to the hardware to indicate the current mode:
    * kernel (0)
    * user (1)
* At system boot time, the hardware starts in kernel mode
    * OS is then loaded and starts user applications in user mode
    * Whenever a trap or interrupt occurs, the hardware switches from user mode to kernel mode
* some instruction - **privileged instructions** are allowed by hardware to be executed only in kernel mode
    * if privileged instruction is asked in user mode, the hardware does not execute it and traps it to the OS
    * e.g.
        * instruciton to switch mode
        * I/O control
        * timer management
        * interrupt management, ...
* mode can be more than 2, e.g
    * seperate mode for virtualiazation, to indicate that virtual machine manager is in charge, it has more privilage then user but less than kernel

---

problem:
* user program can get stuck in an infinite loop or can fail to call system services and never return control to OS

solution :
* timer can be set to interrupt the computer after a specified period
    * variable timer is generally implemented by a fixed-rate clock and a counter
    * OS sets the counter, every time the clock ticks, the counter is decremented
    * when the counter reaches 0, an interrupt occurs
        * e.g.
        * a 10-bit counter with a 1-millisecond clock
            * allows interrupts at intervals from 1 millisecond to 1,024 milliseconds, in steps of 1 millisecond
* before turning over control to the user, OS ensures that the timer is set to interrupt
* if timer interrupts, control transfers automatically to OS, which may treat the interrupt as a
    * fatal error or
    * may give the program more time

On Linux kernel parameters
* **HZ**
    * specifies the frequency of timer interrupts
    * e.g. HZ = 250 means
        * timer generates 250 interrupts per second, or
        * 1 interrupt every 4 milliseconds
* **jiffies**
    * represent the number of timer interrupts that have occurred since the
system was booted
