main jobs of a computer are
* I/O
* computing

in many cases main job is I/O

I/O device technology exhibits two conflicting trends
* increasing standardization of software and hardware interfaces
* increasingly broad variety of I/O devices

kernel uses device-driver modules to tackle different devices
* device drivers provides uniform device access interface to the I/O subsystem

---
**port**
* connection point via which a devic communicates with the machine

**bus**
* if devices share a common set of wires, the connection is called a bus
    * the **PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect)** bus used in most computers today

**daisy chain**
* wiring scheme in which multiple devices are wired together in sequence or in a ring

**controller**
* collection of electronics that can operate a port, a bus, or a device

I/O is performed by device controllers using memory-mapped I/O
* device-control registers are mapped into the address space of the processor
* CPU executes I/O requests using the standard data transfer instructions to read and write the device-control registers at their mapped locations in physical memory

I/O device controller typically consists of four registers
1. data-in register
    * read by the host to get input
2. data-out register
    * written by the host to send output
3. status register
    * contains bits to be ready by host
    * bits indicate states, like,
        * current command completion
        * availablity of bytes to be read from the data-in register
        * error if any
4. control register
    * written by the host
        * to start a command or
        * to change the mode of a device

DMA (direct-memory-access controller)
* OS avoid burdening the main CPU with PIO by offloading some of this work to a special-purpose processor DMA
* CPU writes the address of command block to the DMA controller, then goes on with other work
* DMA controller proceeds to operate the memory bus directly, placing addresses on the bus to perform transfers without the help of the main CPU

Application I/O Interface
* Block and Character Devices
* Network Devices
* Clocks and Timers
* Nonblocking and Asynchronous I/O
* Vectored I/O

---

device identifier in UNIX and Linux is a tuple of **major and minor device numbers**
* major number is the device type
* minor number is the instance of the device

---

* I/O Scheduling
    * **device-status table**
* Buffering
* Caching
* Spooling and Device Reservation
