thread
* basic unit of CPU utilization
* it comprises
    * a thread ID
    * a program counter
    * a register set
    * a stack
* it shares with other threads belonging to the same process its
    * code section
    * data section
    * other operating-system resources, such as open files and signals
* traditional process has a single thread of control

* **Thread Pool**
* **fork-join**
* **OpenMP**
    * set of compiler directives as well as an API for programs written in C, C++, or FORTRAN that provides support for parallel programming in shared-memory environments
    * Open MP identifies parallel regions as blocks of code that may run in parallel
    * Application developers insert compiler directives into their code at parallel regions, and these directives instruct the Open MP run-time library to execute the region in parallel
* **Grand Central Dispatch**
* **Intel Thread Building Blocks**

Linux threads
* Linux doesn't distinguish between process and threads.
* `fork()` system call for process duplicating
* `clone()` system call to create thread
* Linux uses the term task rather than process or thread when referring to a flow of control within a program
* When clone() is invoked, it is passed a set of flags that determine how
much sharing is to take place between the parent and child tasks
* The parent and child tasks will then share the
    * same file-system information (such as the current working directory)
    * same memory space
    * same signal handlers, so on
* Using clone() in this fashion is equivalent to creating a thread, since the parent task shares most of its resources with its child task
* if none of these flags is set when clone() is invoked, no sharing takes place, resulting in functionality similar to that provided by the fork() system call

A unique kernel data structure (specifically, struct task struct ) exists for each task in the system
* This data structure, instead of storing data for the task, contains pointers to other data structures where these data are stored
    * e.g. data structures that represent the list of open files, signal-handling information, and virtual memory
* When fork() is invoked, a new task is created, along with a copy of all the associated data structures of the parent process
* A new task is also created when the clone() system call is made. However, rather than copying all data structures, the new task points to the data structures of the parent task, depending on the set of flags passed to clone()
