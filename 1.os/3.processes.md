> process is a program in execution

section of memory layout of a process:
|||
|-|-|
|Text section   |   the executable code|
|Data section   |   global variables|
|Heap section   |   memory that is dynamically allocated during program run time|
|Stack section  |   temporary data storage when invoking functions (such as function parameters, return addresses, and local variables) |

Sizes of section:
|||
|-|-|
|Text section| fixed|
|Data section| fixed|
|Heap section| will grow as memory is dynamically allocated <br/> and will shrink when memory is returned to the system |
|Stack section | each time a function is called, an **activation record** containing function parameters, local variables, and the return address is pushed onto the stack <br/>when control is returned from the function, the activation record is popped from the stack |

> stack and heap sections grow toward one another, OS does not allow to overlap one another

process is an active entity, with
* aprogram counter specifying the next instruction to execute and
* a set of associated resources

```bash
# size command can be use to see data and text section size
$ size /usr/bin/python3.7m
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
4414433	 677496	 144832	5236761	 4fe819	/usr/bin/python3.7m

#all values are in bytes
# bss - block starting symbol
# bss is the portion of an object file, executable, or assembly language code that contains statically-allocated variables that are declared but have not been assigned a value yet
```

process states: ( arbitrary )
* New - process is being created
* Running - instruction are being executed
* Waiting - waiting for some event to occur
* Ready - process is waiting to be assigned to processor
* Terminated - process has finished execution

---

**process control block (PCB)**
* process in OS is represented by  a **process control block (PCB)** (task control block)
* contains information about process, like:
    * Process state
    * Program counter
        indicates the address of the next instruction to be executed for the process
    * CPU registers
        * registers vary in number and type, depending on the computer architecture
        * include accumulators, index registers, stack pointers, and general-purpose registers, plus any condition-code information
    * CPU -scheduling information
        * includes a process priority
        * pointers to scheduling queues, and any other scheduling parameters
    * Memory-management information
        * include value of the base and limit registers and the page tables, or the segment tables, depending on the memory system used by the OS
    * Accounting information
        * includes the amount of CPU and real time used, time limits, account numbers job or process numbers, so on
    * I/O status information
        * includes the list of I/O devices allocated to the process, a list of open files, and so on

**Process Scheduling**
* objective of time sharing is to switch a CPU core among processes so frequently that users can interact with each program while it is running
* number of processes currently in memory is known as the **degree of multiprogramming**
* Balancing the objectives of multiprogramming and time sharing also
requires taking the general behavior of a process into account
    * most processes can be described as either
        * I/O bound - one that spends more of its time doing I/O
        * CPU bound - one that spends more of its time doing computation

Scheduling queues
* ready queue
* set of waiting queues, like:
    * I/O wait queue
    * child termination wait queue
    * interrupt wait queue

> queues are generally stored as a linked list of PCB

* new process or processes ready to be executed on CPU's core are is put into ready queue
* processes waiting for a certain event to occur(e.g. I/O) are placed in a wait queue


> processs in ready queue waits until it is selected for execution, or dispatched

Once the process is allocated a CPU core and is executing, one of several events could occur:
* process could issue an I/O request
    * and then be placed in an I/O wait queue
* process could create a new child process
    * and then be placed in a wait queue while it awaits the child’s termination
* process could be removed forcibly from the core
    * as a result of an interrupt or having its time slice expire,
    * and be put back in the ready queue

> process continues this cycle of moving in out of queues until it terminates, at which time it is removed from all queues and has its PCB and resources deallocated

---

**CPU scheduling**

* role of the CPU scheduler is to select process from ready queue and allocate a CPU core to it
* scheduler may remove CPU from process forcibly and assign CPU to another process
* CPU scheduler executes at least once every 100 milliseconds, although typically much more frequently


**Swapping**
* removing a process from memory (and from active contention for the CPU ) and thus reduce the degree of multiprogramming
* Later, the process can be reintroduced into memory, and its execution can be continued where it left off
* i.e. process can swapped out from memory to disk or swapped in from disk to memory
* Swapping is typically only necessary when memory has been overcommitted and must be freed up


**Context switch**
* Switching the CPU core to another process requires
    * performing a state save of the current process and
    * a state restore of a different process
    * task is known as a **context switch**
* Context-switch time is pure overhead, because the system does no useful work while switching
* Switching speed varies from machine to machine, depending on the memory speed, the number of registers that must be copied, and the existence of special instructions (such as a single instruction to load or store all registers)
* Context-switch times are highly dependent on hardware support

---


**cascading termination**
* if a process terminates (either normally or abnormally), then all its children must also be terminated

When a process terminates
* its resources are deallocated by the OS
* its entry in the process table must remain there until the parent calls wait()  because the process table contains the process’s exit status
* A process that has terminated, but whose parent has not yet called wait() , is
known as a **zombie process**
* All processes transition to this state when they terminate, but generally they exist as zombies only briefly
* Once the parent calls wait() , the process identifier of the zombie process and its entry in the process table are released
* if a parent did not invoke wait() and instead terminated, thereby leaving its child processes as orphans
* Traditional UNIX systems addressed this scenario by assigning the init process as the new parent to orphan processes
* The init process periodically invokes wait() , thereby allowing the exit status of any orphaned process to be collected and releasing the orphan’s process identifier and process-table entry
* Although most Linux systems have replaced init with systemd , the latter
process can still serve the same role, although Linux also allows processes other
than systemd to inherit orphan processes and manage their termination

**interprocess communication ( IPC )**
* shared memory
* message passing

Shared memory can be faster than message passing, since message-passing systems are typically implemented using system calls and thus require the more time-consuming task of kernel intervention

In shared-memory systems, system calls are required only to establish shared memory regions. Once shared memory is established, all accesses are treated as routine memory accesses, and no assistance from the kernel is required.

IPC in Shared-Memory Systems
* OS tries to prevent one process from accessing another process’s memory
* Shared memory requires that two or more processes agree to remove this restriction
* typically a shared-memory region resides in the address space of the process creating the shared-memory segment
* Other processes that wish to communicate using this shared-memory segment must attach it to their address space
* They can then exchange information by reading and writing data in the shared areas completely independent from OS

POSIX Shared Memory ???
* POSIX shared memory is organized using memory-mapped files
    * which associate the region of shared memory with a file
* A process must first create a shared-memory object using the shm_open() system call, * A successful call to shm open() returns an integer file descriptor for the shared-memory object
* Once the object is established, the ftruncate() function is used to configure the size of the object in bytes
* Finally, the mmap() function establishes a memory-mapped file containing the shared-memory object
    * It also returns a pointer to the memory-mapped file that is used for accessing the shared-memory object

**Named pipes** are referred to as **FIFOs** in UNIX systems
* Once created, they appear as typical files in the file system
* A FIFO is created with the mkfifo() system call and
* manipulated with the ordinary open() , read() , write() , and close() system calls. * It will continue to exist until it is explicitly deleted
* FIFOs allow bidirectional communication, only half-duplex transmission is permitted
* If data must travel in both directions, two FIFOs are typically used
* the communicating processes must reside on the same machine
