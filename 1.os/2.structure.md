OS services :
* UI (User Interface)
    * GUI - graphical user interface
    * CLI - command line interface
    * touch-screen interface
* Program execution
* I/O operations
* File system manipulation
* Communications ( process to process )
    * may be implemeneted via
        * shared memory
        * message passing
* Error detection
    * OS need to detect and correct errors constantly
    * e.g. errors may occur in
        * CPU, memory hardware ( memeory error or power failure)
        * I/O devices (parity error on disk, connection failure, lack of paper in printer)
        * user program ( airthmetic overflow or attemtpt to access an illegal memory location)
* Resource allocation (to processes)
    * CPU cycles, main memory, file storage, etc
* Logging
    * to keep track which process use how much and what kinds of resources
    * to be used by accounting or system administrators
* Protection and security

**System calls**
* provides an interface to the services made available by OS
* generally available as functions written in
    * **C** and **C++**
    * some (low-lvel tasks) in **assembly-languages** too
* even simple program like cp uses a lot of syscalls
* frequently, system executes thousands of system call per second
* programmers generally don't use syscalls directly but via **API** (application programming interfae)
    * WIndows API for windows
    * POSIX API for POSIX based systems (virtually all linux, macOS, UNIX)
    * Java API for Java virtual machine

> **libc** => C library for linux, unix

invoking API instead of syscalls benefits:
* program portability

**run-time environment (RTE)**
* full suite of software needed to execute applications written in a given programming language, including its compilers or interpreters or libraries or loaders
* RTE provides **system-call interface** that serves as the link to system calls made available by OS
* system-call interface intercepts funciton calls in the API and invokes required system calls
* typically a number is associated with each system call
    * system call interface maintains a table indexed acc to these numbers
* e.g.
    * standard C library provides a portion of system call interface for linux
        * printf() statement invokes system calls
            * write() in this case and
            * return values returned by write() syscall back to user program

to pass parameters to OS:
* pass parameter in registers
    * problem
        * there may be more parameters than registers
    * solution
        * store parameters in block or table in memory
        * and pass address of block in register
    * both approaches are used by Linux e.g.
        * if 5 or less parameters to pass, registers are used
        * otherwise, block method is used


system calls roughly categories :
|||||
|-|-|-|-|
|1|process control        | create process, terminate process <br/> load execute <br/> get process attributes, set process attributes <br/> wait event, signal event <br/> allocate and free memory | fork() <br/> exit() <br/> wait()|
|2|file managment         |create file, delete file <br/> open, close <br/> read, write, reposition <br/> get file attributes, set file attributes | open() <br/> read()<br/> write() <br/> close()
|3|device management      | request device, release device <br/> read, write, reposition <br/> get device attributes, set device attributes <br/> logically attach or detach devices | ioctl() <br/> read() <br/> write() |
|4|information maintenance| get time or date, set time or date <br/> get system data, set system data <br/> get process, file, or device attributes <br/> set process, file, or device attributes | getpid() <br/> alarm() <br/> sleep() |
|5|communications         | create, delete communication connection <br/> send, receive messages <br/> transfer status information <br/> attach or detach remote devices | pipe() <br/> shm_open() <br/> mmap() |
|6|protection             | get file permissions <br/> set file permissions | chmod() <br/> umask() <br/> chown() |

> I/O devices and files are very similar, unix merged the two in combined file-device structure. a set of system calls can be used on both files and devices.

**Linkers and Loaders**
* Source files are compiled into **object files** (designed to be loaded into any physical memory location, fomrat known as **relocatable object file**)
* **linker** combines these relocatable object files intto a single binary **executable** file
    * other object files ot libraries may be included as well
* **loader** is used to load binary executable file into memory where it is eligible to run on CPU core

e.g. ./program in unix
* shell will create a new process by calling **fork()** system call
* shell will invoke loader via **exec*()* system call
* loader will load the asked program into memory usig address space of newly created process

> most systems allow a program to dynamically link libraries as the program is loaded

> [Object files aren't "needed" from a theoretical point of view. They're just very practical (and actually necessary technically with some (most?) toolchains, being the things the assembler knows how to produce and the linker knows how to link).](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14001265/3143562)

* Object files and executable files typically have standard formats that
include the compiled machine code and a symbol table containing metadata
about functions and variables that are referenced in the program.
* linux, standard format is known as **ELF (executable and linkable format)**
    * there are separate format for relocatable and executable files
    * one piece in ELF file for executable is the program's entry point, which contains the address of first instruction to be executed
* windows, **Portable Executable (PE) format**
* macOS, **Mach-O** format

OS structure
* Monolithic structure
    * single static binary
* Layered approach
    * expensive, succefull in network but not in OS
* MicroKernel
    * remove all non-essential componenets from kernel and implement them as user level programs
* Modules **(loadable kernel modules LKMs)**
    * kernel can link additional serices via modules either at boot time or run time
* Hybrid

**Booting**

**BIOS** (basic input/output system) (multistage boot process)
* power on => BIOS is run, located in nonvolatile firmware
* this initial boot loader load a second boot loader which is located at a fixed disk location called the **boot block**
* program stored in the boot block may be sophisticated enough to load the entire operating system into memory and begin its execution
* more typically, it is simple code (as it must fit in a single disk block) and knows only the address on disk and the length of the remainder of the bootstrap program

**UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)** has replaced **BIOS**
* advantages over BIOS
    * including better support for 64-bit systems and larger disks
    * it is a single, complete boot manager and faster than the multistage BIOS boot process


Whether booting from BIOS or UEFI , the bootstrap program can perform a variety of tasks
* runs diagnostics to determine the state of the machine
    * e.g. inspecting memory and the CPU and discovering devices
* if the diagnostics pass, the program can continue with the booting steps
* bootstrap can also initialize all aspects of the system, from CPU registers to
device controllers and the contents of main memory
* it starts the operating system and mounts the root file system

**GRUB (GNU GRand Unified Bootloader)**
* open-source bootstrap program for Linux and UNIX systems
* Boot parameters for the system are set in a GRUB configuration file, which is loaded at startup
* GRUB is flexible and allows changes to be made at boot time
    * including modifying kernel parameters
    * selecting among different kernels that can be booted

> To save space as well as decrease boot time, the Linux kernel image is a
compressed file that is extracted after it is loaded into memory

* the boot loader typically creates a temporary RAM file system, known
as **initramfs**
    * this file system contains necessary drivers and kernel modules that must be installed to support the real root file system (which is not in main
memory)
* Once the kernel has started and the necessary drivers are installed,
the kernel switches the root file system from the temporary RAM location to
the appropriate root file system location
* finally, Linux creates the systemd process, the initial process in the system, and then starts other services


> boot loaders provide booting into recovery mode or single-user mode for diagnosing hardware issues, fixing corrupt file systems, and even reinstalling the operating system

Performance monitoring tools  can be categorized into:
* per process
* system-wide

tools may use one of two approaches :
1. counters
2. tracing

e.g.

Counters
* per-process
    * ps
    * top

* system-wide
    * vmstat
    * netstat
    * iostat

> most of the counter-based tools on linux systems read statistics from /proc file system

Tracing
* per-process
    * strace
    * gdb

* system-wide
    * perf
    * tcpdump

**BCC** (BPF Compiler Collection)
* rich toolkit that provides tracing features for linux systems
* BPF tech was developed in the early 1990s for filtering traffic across a computer network.
* BCC is a front-end interface to the eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) tool
* eBPF instructions are passed through verifier which makes sure that instructions do not affect system perfomance or security
* BCC was developed to write tools in Python instead of C.
* BCC tool is written in Python and it embeds C code that interfaces with the eBPF instrumentation, which in turn interfaces with the kernel
* BCC tool also compiles the C program into e BPF instructions and inserts it into the kernel using either probes or tracepoints, two techniques that allow tracing events in the Linux kernel
