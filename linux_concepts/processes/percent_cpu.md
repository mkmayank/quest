> **%CPU** -- CPU Usage : The percentage of your CPU that is being used by the process. By default, top displays this as a percentage of a single CPU. On multi-core systems, you can have percentages that are greater than 100%. For example, if 3 cores are at 60% use,  top will show a CPU use of 180%. See here for more information. You can toggle this behavior by hitting Shifti while top is running to show the overall percentage of available CPUs in use.
