- A 9-patch image file is specially formatted so that Android knows which portions can and cannot be scaled.

A 9-patch image is like a regular PNG image in everything except two aspects:
    -   Its filename ends with .9.png
    -   it has an additional one-pixel border around the edge.
        This border is used to specify the location of the center square of the 9-patch.
        Border pixels are drawn black to indicate the center and transparent to indicate the edges.


We can create a 9-patch using any image editor, with the draw9patch tool
