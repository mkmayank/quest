- filenames must be lowercase and have no spaces
- file must be located in res/drawable

- using string
    in xml
        android:drawableRight="@drawable/awesomeimage"
    in code


 e.g.
     MyProject/
         res/
             drawable-xhdpi/
                 awesomeimage.png
             drawable-hdpi/
                 awesomeimage.png
             drawable-mdpi/
                 awesomeimage.png
             drawable-ldpi/
                 awesomeimage.png

     Any .png, .jpg, or .gif file you add to a res/drawable folder will be automatically assigned a resource ID.
     Any reference @drawable/awesomeimage, the system selects the appropriate bitmap based on the screen's density.


putting default drawable resources in res/drawable/ is not necessary
Android scales available resources according to screen and density
