- A resource is a piece of your application that is not code â€“ things like image files, audio files, and XML files.
- in a subdirectory of the app/res

- To access a resource in code, use its resource ID
e.g.
    - code
        R.layout.activity_quiz
        R.string.app_name

    - XML
        android:id="@+id/edit_message"
        "@string/edit_message"

        @ is required to refer to any resource object from XML.
        followed by the resource type (id in this case), a slash, then the resource name (edit_message).
        + before the resource type is needed only when defining a resource ID for the first time.
