manifest - an XML file containing metadata that describes your application to the Android OS.
The file is always named AndroidManifest.xml, and it lives in the app/manifests directory of project.
Every activity in an application must be declared in the manifest so that the OS can access it.

minSdkVersion       :   value is a hard floor below which the OS should refuse to install the app
targetSdkVersion    :   value tells Android which API level your app is designed to run on
