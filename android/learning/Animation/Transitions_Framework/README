transitions framework


The framework has the following features:

-   Group-level animations      -   Applies one or more animation effects to all of the views in a view hierarchy.
-   Transition-based animation  -   Runs animations based on the changes between starting and ending view property values.
-   Built-in animations         -   Includes predefined animations
-   Resource file support       -   Loads view hierarchies and built-in animations from layout resource files.
-   Lifecycle callbacks         -   Defines callbacks that provide finer control over the animation and hierarchy change process.

-----------------------------------

-   scenes
-   transitions
-   transition managers
Steps :
1.  create scenes for the view hierarchies in app that we plan to change between
2.  create a transition for each animation to use
3.  use transition manager to start the animation between two view hierarchies, by specifying
        the transition to use and
        the ending scene
