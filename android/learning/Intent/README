An intent is an object that a component can use to communicate with the OS.

intent to tell the ActivityManager which activity to start, constructor:

    public Intent(Context packageContext, Class<?> cls)

The Context - tells the ActivityManager which application package the activity class can be found in.
The Class   - specifies the activity class that the ActivityManager should start.


explicit intent - to start activities within same application.
implicit intent - to start an activity in another application.

-------------------------

Activity.getIntent() always returns the Intent that started the activity

    mAnswerIsTrue = getIntent().getBooleanExtra(EXTRA_ANSWER_IS_TRUE, false);
