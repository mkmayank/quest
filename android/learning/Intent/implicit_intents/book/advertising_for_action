An activity would advertise itself as an appropriate activity for ACTION_VIEW via an intent filter in the manifest.
e.g.
    for browser app:

<activity
    android:name=".BrowserActivity"
    android:label="@string/app_name" >
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <data android:scheme="http" android:host="www.bignerdranch.com" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>

To respond to implicit intents, a DEFAULT category must be set explicitly in an intent filter.
The action element in the intent filter tells the OS that the activity is capable of performing the job,
and the DEFAULT category tells the OS that this activity should be considered for the job when the OS is asking for volunteers.
