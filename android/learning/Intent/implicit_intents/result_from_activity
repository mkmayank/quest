startActivityForResult( intent , request_code );

    e.g.
    startActivityForResult(pickContactIntent, PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST);

    recieve result

    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        // Check which request we're responding to
        if (requestCode == PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST) {
            // Make sure the request was successful
            if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
                // now do something
            }
        }
    }

-   request code    -   which we passed to startActivityForResult()
-   result code     -   either RESULT_OK if the operation was successful
                        or RESULT_CANCELED if the user backed out or the operation failed for some reason
-   Intent data     -   result data
