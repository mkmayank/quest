Extras are arbitrary data that the calling activity can include with an intent.
The OS forwards the intent to the recipient activity, which can then access the extras and retrieve the data.
An extra is structured as a key-value pair

To add an extra to an intent, use Intent.putExtra(…).

    public Intent putExtra(String name, boolean value)

Intent.putExtra(…) comes in many flavors, but it always has two arguments.
The first argument is always a String key
the second argument is the value, whose type will vary.
It returns the Intent itself, so you can chain multiple calls if you need to.

-----------------------------

Extra Key :
    private static final String EXTRA_ANSWER_IS_TRUE =
        "com.bignerdranch.android.geoquiz.answer_is_true";

    we should define keys for extras on the activities that retrieve and use them.
    Using package name as a qualifier for extra, prevents name collisions with extras from other apps
    define in second activity

-----------------------------

Now you could return to FirstActivity and put the extra on the intent, but there is a better approach.
There is no reason for FirstActivity, or any other code in your app, to know the implementation details of what SecondActivity expects as extras on its Intent.
Instead, we can encapsulate that work into a newIntent(…) method.

    public static Intent newIntent(Context packageContext, boolean answerIsTrue) {
        Intent i = new Intent(packageContext, SecondActivity.class);
        i.putExtra(EXTRA_ANSWER_IS_TRUE, answerIsTrue);
        return i;
    }

To retrieve the value from the extra :

    public boolean getBooleanExtra(String name, boolean defaultValue)

The first argument is the name of the extra.
The second argument is a default value if the key is not found.

    mAnswerIsTrue = getIntent().getBooleanExtra(EXTRA_ANSWER_IS_TRUE, false);

Activity.getIntent() always returns the Intent that started the activity
