getWritableDatabase() and getReadableDatabase() are expensive to call when the database is closed
should leave your database connection open for as long as you possibly need to access it
it is optimal to close the database in the onDestroy() of the calling Activity

@Override
protected void onDestroy() {
    mDbHelper.close();
    super.onDestroy();
}
