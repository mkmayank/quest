By default, the retainInstance property of a fragment is false


Retained fragments take advantage of the fact that a fragment’s view can be destroyed and re-created without having to destroy the fragment itself.

A retained fragment is not destroyed, but it is detached from the dying activity. This puts the fragment in a retained state. The fragment still exists, but it is not hosted by any activity


The retained state is only entered into when two conditions are met:

setRetainInstance(true) has been called on the fragment

the hosting activity is being destroyed for a configuration change (typically rotation)

A fragment is only in the retained state for an extremely brief interval – the time between being detached from the old activity and being reattached to the new activity that is immediately created.

not recommend using this mechanism unless you absolutely need to, for a couple of reasons :
