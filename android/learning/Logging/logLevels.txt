Android supports five log levels :

ERROR   -   Log.e(...)
WARNING -   Log.w(...)
INFO    -   Log.i(...)
DEBUG   -   Log.d(...)
VERBOSE -   Log.v(...)

each of the logging methods has two signatures:
1. which takes a tag string and a message string
2. that takes those two arguments plus an instance of Throwable , which makes it easy to log information about a particular exception that your application might throw.

e.g.

    // Log a message at "debug" log level
    Log.d(TAG, "Current question index: " + mCurrentIndex);

    ---------------

    Question question;
    try {
        question = mQuestionBank[mCurrentIndex];
    } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException ex) {
    
        // Log a message at "error" log level, along with an exception stack trace
        Log.e(TAG, "Index was out of bounds", ex);
    }
