Every instance of Activity has a lifecycle. During this lifecycle, an activity transitions between three
states: running, paused, and stopped. For each transition, there is an Activity method that notifies the
activity of the change in its state.
onResume()
onPause()
onStart()
onStop()
onCreate()
onDestroy()

---------------------------
public class QuizActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private Button mTrueButton;
    private Button mFalseButton;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        //inflating widgets and putting them on screen
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_quiz);
    }
}

AppCompatActivity - subclass of Android’s Activity class that provides compatibility support for older versions of Android.
----------------------------

Never call any of the Activity lifecycle methods yourself. Override them in activity subclasses, and Android calls them at the appropriate time.

Launching   : onCreate() -> onStart() -> onResume()

Back Button : onPause() -> onStop() -> onDestroy()

Home Button : onPause() -> onStop()

no onDestoy() called
However, a stopped activity’s survival is not guaranteed. When the system needs to reclaim memory, it will destroy stopped activities.

Recent Button : onStart() -> onResume()

Rotation : onPause() -> onStop() -> onDestroy() -> onCreate() -> onStart() -> onResume()
