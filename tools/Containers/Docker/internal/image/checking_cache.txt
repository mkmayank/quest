    -   Docker looks for an existing image in its cache that it can reuse, rather than creating a new (duplicate) image
    -   --no-cache=true option to turn off cache in docker build

    -   each instruction is checked if any child image from base image already built or in cache

    -   mostly, comparing the instruction in the Dockerfile with one of the child images is sufficient

    -   For ADD and COPY instructions, checksum for each file (content + metadata) is calculated and checked
        last-modified and last-accessed times are not considered in checksums

    -   Aside from the ADD and COPY commands, cache checking does not look at the files in the container
        e.g,
            RUN apt-get -y update
            files updated in the container are not examined
            just the command string itself is used to find a match

    -   Build cache is only used from images that have a local parent chain
    -   to use cache from specific imahe use --cache-from

Layman:
agar docker ko beech me koi image mil jaay cache me to wo use use karegaa aagey kii instructions ke liye
