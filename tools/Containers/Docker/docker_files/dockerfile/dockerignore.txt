.dockerignore
    -   define patterns to exclude files and directories that match patterns in it while building image

    -   newline-separated list of patterns similar to the file globs of Unix shells
    -   Matching is done using Goâ€™s filepath.Match rules

    -   #   -   comment ( if first character in line )
    -   **  -   matches any number of directories
        e.g.
            **/*.go
            # will exclude all files that end with .go

    -   !   -   to make exceptions to exclusions ( at start of line )
        e.g.
            *.md
            !README.md
            # All markdown files except README.md are excluded from the context

    -   patterns override patterns in previous lines
