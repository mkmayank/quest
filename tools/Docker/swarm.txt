    -   a group of machines that are running Docker and joined into a cluster
    -   after joining a swarm, machines are referred to as nodes

        authorize other machines to join the swarm as workers

$ docker swarm init     #   to init swarm mode

$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr <IP>               #   to make swarm manager
$ docker swarm join --token <TOKEN> <IP:PORT>           #   to make swarm worker
$ docker node ls                                        #   to see swarm nodes
$ docker swarm join-token worker"                       #   to see swarm token of worker
$ docker swarm join-token manager"                      #   to see swarm token of manager
