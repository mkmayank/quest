MPM :
    -   Multi-Processing Modules
    -   https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mpm.html
    -   https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/
    -   responsible for
        -   binding to network ports,
        -   accepting requests, and
        -   dispatching children to handle the requests
    -   one and only one MPM must be loaded into the server at any time
    -   Benefits :
        -   Apache httpd can support a wide variety of operating systems
        -   The server can be customized for the needs of the particular site

==========================

Modules :
    Netware	mpm_netware
    OS/2	mpmt_os2
    Unix	prefork, worker, or event, depending on platform capabilities
    Windows	mpm_winnt

==========================

prefork :
    -   https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/prefork.html
    -   non-threaded, pre-forking web server
    -   a single parent control process manages the size of the server pool, responsible for launching child processes and serve them when requests arive
    -   most important directive : MaxRequestWorkers
    -   child process can be launced by less-privileged user

worker :
    -   https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/worker.html
    -   hybrid multi-process multi-threaded server
    -   most important directives
        -   ThreadsPerChild -   number of threads deployed by each child process
        -   MaxRequestWorkers - maximum total number of threads that may be launched
    -   a sinle parent control process is responsible for launching child processes
    -   each child process creates a fixed number of server threads and listener thread which listens for connections and passes them to a server thread for processing when they arrive

event :
    -   https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/event.html
    -   hybrid multi-process multi-threaded server
    -   tries to fix the 'keep alive problem' in HTTP
    -   consistent socket are listend by listener threads and work is done by worker threads and worker thread can be freed , when no more work to do but connection is still alive
