    -   Apache HTTP Server is configured by placing directives in plain text configuration files
    -   Directives placed in the main configuration files apply to the entire server
    -   Directives can be scoped by placing in
            -   <Directory>
            -   <DirectoryMatch>
            -   <Files>
            -   <FilesMatch>
            -   <Location>
            -   <LocationMatch>
            -   <VirtualHost>
    -    There are two basic types of containers
        -   evaluated for each request
            -    mostly all
        -   evaluated only at server startup and restart
            -   <IfDefine>
            -   <IfModule>
            -   <IfVersion>

    -   http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/bind.html
    -   The server will respond to requests from any of the listed addresses and ports.
    -   e.g,
            Listen 80
            Listen 8000
            Listen 192.0.2.1:80
            Listen 192.0.2.5:8000
            Listen [2001:db8::a00:20ff:fea7:ccea]:80
            Listen 192.170.2.1:8443 https

======================
map a particular URL to an internal Apache HTTP Server handler provided by mod_status
No file called server-status needs to exist in the filesystem.

<Location "/server-status">
    SetHandler server-status
</Location>
