CGI :
    -   Common Gateway interface
    -   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2089271/what-is-common-gateway-interface-cgi
    -   requires new process to be spawned on every request

    -   http://people.apache.org/~jim/ApacheCons/ApacheCon2001/xml-ca/files/F18-FastCGI/f18fastcgi.html
    -   OpenMarket developed FastCGI
    -   It is a protocol
    -   one process is spawned and it keeps on ,listening for further request
    -   FastCGI applications can be run on different machines than webserver is running
    -   FastCGI can be implemented in any language that supports network sockets
    -   Cannot use PHP directives in .htaccess
    -   Files are owned by users
    -   statoc content is processed without interpreter

mod_php :
    -   apache module
    -   apache executes the php code, php code executes in apache process space
    -   Can use PHP directives in .htaccess
    -   need php interpreter for even static content(non php)
    -   files are owned by apache

=========================

Like CGI
    FastCGI is also language-independent
    FastCGI runs applications in processes isolated from the core Web server
    FastCGI is not tied to the internal architecture of any Web server

==========================

FPM :
    -   FastCGI process manager
    -   http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php
    -   PHP FastCGI implementation
    -   ability to start workers with different uid/gid/chroot/environment, listening on different ports and using different php.ini (replaces safe_mode)
