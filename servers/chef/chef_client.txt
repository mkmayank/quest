Ohai ( tool )
    -   to collect system configuration data
    -   run by the chef-client at the beginning of every Chef run to determine system state
    -   includes many built-in plugins to detect common configuration details
    -   custom plugins can also be written
    -   e.g. attributes Ohai collects
            -   Operating System, Network, Memory, Disk, CPU, Kernel, Host names, FQDN, ...
    -   Attributes collected by Ohai are automatic level attributes
    -   these attributes are used to ensure that these attributes remain unchanged after the chef-client is done configuring the node
