The search engine is based on Apache Solr and is run from the Chef server.


-   RSA public key-pairs are used to authenticate the chef-client with the Chef server,
    every time a chef-client needs access to data that is stored on the Chef server.
    This prevents any node from accessing data that it shouldnâ€™t and
    it ensures that only nodes that are properly registered with the Chef server can be managed.
