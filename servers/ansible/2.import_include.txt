    -   Ansible has two modes of operation for reusable content:
            1.  dynamic     -   include
            2.  static      -   import

    -   any import* Task (import_playbook, import_tasks, etc.), it will be static
    -   any include* Task (include_tasks, include_role, etc.), it will be dynamic

    -   All import* statements are pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed
    -   All include* statements are processed as they encountered during the execution of the playbook


import_playbook
    -   The plays and tasks in each playbook listed will be run in the order they are listed, just as if they had been defined here directly.

            - import_playbook: webservers.yml
            - import_playbook: databases.yml

import_tasks / include_tasks
    -   A task file simply contains a flat list of tasks
    -   task file
    
            # common_tasks.yml
            - name: placeholder foo
              command: /bin/foo
            - name: placeholder bar
              command: /bin/bar

            tasks:
            - import_tasks: common_tasks.yml
            # or
            - include_tasks: common_tasks.yml

    -   to pass variables into imports and includes

            tasks:
            - import_tasks: wordpress.yml
              vars:
                wp_user: timmy
            - import_tasks: wordpress.yml
              vars:
                wp_user: alice
            - import_tasks: wordpress.yml
              vars:
                wp_user: bob

    -   to use in handlrs :

            # more_handlers.yml
            - name: restart apache
              service: name=apache state=restarted
            And in your main playbook file:

            handlers:
            - include_tasks: more_handlers.yml
            # or
            - import_tasks: more_handlers.yml
