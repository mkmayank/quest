    -   to use variable

            {{ variable_name }}

    -   quote the whole line of variable

                - hosts: app_servers
                  vars:
                    app_path: "{{ base_path }}/22"

    -   Information discovered from remote systems: Facts
            ansible hostname -m setup

    -   Turning Off Facts
        -   This has advantages in scaling Ansible in push mode with very large numbers of systems
            In any play, just do this:

                - hosts: whatever
                  gather_facts: no

    -   Ansible facts are a way of getting data about remote systems for use in playbook variables
        these are discovered automatically by the setup module in Ansible

    -   Facts.d
            -   to provide variable on remote system
            -   /etc/ansible/facts.d directory on remote system => any files in this directory ending in .fact, can be JSON, INI, or executable files returning JSON
            -   An alternate directory can be specified using the fact_path play directive.
