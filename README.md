# quest
**Job seeker** in Linux world
* Location Soft Preference : Remote or London
* Location Hard Preference : None, Anywhere in world, Love to explore geography

Titles I would love, but not limited to
* Production Enginner , Site Reliability engineer (SRE) , DevOps engineer

My stupid mind's state consists of a cycle of
* swimming in Linux ocean and
* seeking FIRE by finding ways to increase income (can't decrease expenses)

Every moment, my stupid mind alternate between these two states.


## About repo
I revise the **Linux concepts** which I should have already know and then learn new concepts which I should have already be learned

This repo is my notebook, where I note down, revise and get back whenever I need help for the concepts which I study.
I study from ebooks, blogs, wikipedia.
If any concept is here, I understand it.

Notes are in point form (my stupid mind's context), if it can help somebody in understanding, I would be very happy.
